# 🛒 Project: E-Commerce Metrics Platform

This project is a simplified simulation of an **E-Commerce Metrics Platform**, inspired by large-scale systems like Google Shopping. The platform ingests, processes, and analyzes e-commerce data to generate meaningful insights for merchants, such as sales trends, top-performing products, and customer feedback summaries.
